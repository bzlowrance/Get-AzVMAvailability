## Overview

Get-AzVMAvailability helps you identify which Azure regions have available capacity for your VM deployments. It scans multiple regions in parallel and provides detailed insights into SKU availability, zone restrictions, quota limits, pricing, and image compatibility.

## What's New

### v2.0.0 — Module Conversion (April 2026)
- **Smart default regions** — defaults now auto-detect based on cloud environment (Gov, China) and local timezone (Americas, Europe, APAC, etc.) — no more commercial defaults when connected to sovereign clouds
- **PowerShell module** — install via `Install-Module AzVMAvailability` from PSGallery, or import directly from the repo
- **Core interface unchanged** — all 39 parameters, output formats, and interactive prompts are identical to v1.14.0; only the default region selection is smarter
- **Thin wrapper** — `Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1` still works as a standalone entry point (imports the module and forwards parameters)
- **Private functions** — 43 helper functions are now truly private; only `Get-AzVMAvailability` is exported
- **CI/CD publishing** — automated PSGallery + GitHub Release publishing on merge to main

### v1.14.0 — Lifecycle & Deployment Mapping (April 2026)
- **Lifecycle Recommendations** — feed a CSV/JSON/XLSX of deployed VMs and get retirement risk analysis with up to 6 upgrade alternatives per SKU, powered by a curated upgrade-path knowledge base
- **`-SubMap` / `-RGMap`** — new deployment mapping sheets in XLSX exports, grouping affected VMs by subscription or resource group with risk-level enrichment
- **`-Tag` filter** — filter live VM inventory scans by Azure resource tags (key=value or key=`*`)
- **`-RateOptimization`** — opt-in Savings Plan and Reserved Instance pricing columns alongside PAYG

> Full history: [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Features

- **Multi-Region Parallel Scanning** - Scan 10+ regions in ~15 seconds using concurrent HttpClient-based REST calls
- **SKU Filtering** - Filter to specific SKUs with wildcard support (e.g., `Standard_D*_v5`)
- **Lifecycle Recommendations** - Analyze deployed VMs for retirement risk; get up to 6 upgrade alternatives per SKU from a curated knowledge base + real-time scoring engine
- **Live Lifecycle Scan** - Pull VM inventory directly from Azure via Resource Graph with management group, resource group, and tag filters
- **Deployment Mapping** - `-SubMap` / `-RGMap` sheets group affected VMs by subscription or resource group with risk enrichment
- **Pricing Information** - Show hourly/monthly pricing (retail or negotiated EA/MCA rates) with optional Savings Plan and Reserved Instance comparisons
- **Spot VM Pricing** - Include Spot pricing alongside on-demand rates
- **Placement Scores** - Show allocation likelihood (High/Medium/Low) for each SKU via Azure Spot Placement API
- **Image Compatibility** - Verify Gen1/Gen2 and x64/ARM64 requirements
- **Zone Availability** - Per-zone availability details
- **Quota Tracking** - Available vCPU quota per family
- **Multi-Region Matrix** - Color-coded comparison view
- **Interactive Drill-Down** - Explore specific families and SKUs
- **Export Options** - CSV and styled XLSX with conditional formatting
- **JSON Output** - Structured JSON for AI agent integration and automation pipelines
- **Inventory Readiness** - Validate capacity and quota for an entire VM BOM in one command
- **Compatibility-Validated Recommendations** - Alternatives are validated to meet or exceed the target SKU's NICs, accelerated networking, premium IO, disk interface, ephemeral OS disk, and Ultra SSD requirements. Data disks and IOPS are scored as soft dimensions

- **Disaster Recovery Planning** - Identify backup regions with capacity
- **Multi-Region Deployments** - Find regions where all required SKUs are available
- **GPU/HPC Workloads** - NC, ND, NV series are often constrained; find where they're available
- **Inventory Readiness Validation** - Verify capacity and quota for an entire VM BOM before deployment
- **Image Compatibility** - Verify SKUs support your Gen2 or ARM64 images before deployment
- **Troubleshooting Deployments** - Quickly identify why a deployment might be failing

## Requirements

- **PowerShell 7.0+** (required)
- **Azure PowerShell Modules**: `Az.Accounts`, `Az.Compute`, `Az.Resources`
- **Optional**: `ImportExcel` module for styled XLSX export
- **Optional**: `Az.ResourceGraph` module for `-LifecycleScan` live VM inventory

## Quick Start

### Option A: Module (recommended)

```powershell
# Install from PSGallery (available after v2.0.0 release)
Install-Module AzVMAvailability -Repository PSGallery

# Or import directly from the repo
Import-Module .\AzVMAvailability

# Login and scan
Connect-AzAccount
Get-AzVMAvailability -Region "eastus" -NoPrompt
```

### Option B: Script (unchanged)

```powershell
# Interactive Login to Azure
Connect-AzAccount -Tenant YourTenantIdHere -subscription YourSubIdHere

# Interactive mode - prompts for all options
.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1

# Automated mode - uses current subscription
.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -NoPrompt -Region "eastus","westus2"

# With auto-export
.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -Region "eastus","eastus2" -AutoExport

# Inventory readiness check from CSV file
.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -InventoryFile .\examples\fleet-bom.csv -Region "eastus" -NoPrompt

# Lifecycle analysis — find old-gen SKUs and recommend replacements
.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -LifecycleRecommendations .\my-vms.csv -Region "eastus" -NoPrompt

# Lifecycle analysis — from Azure portal VM export (XLSX)
.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -LifecycleRecommendations .\AzureVirtualMachines.xlsx -NoPrompt

# Live lifecycle scan — pull VM inventory directly from Azure
.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -LifecycleScan -NoPrompt
```

## Script vs Module

As of v2.0.0, Get-AzVMAvailability is available as both a standalone script and a PowerShell module. **Existing script users see no changes** — the `.ps1` file still works exactly as before.

| | Script (`.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1`) | Module (`Get-AzVMAvailability`) |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** | `git clone` or download ZIP | `Install-Module AzVMAvailability` |
| **Run** | `.\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -Region eastus` | `Get-AzVMAvailability -Region eastus` |
| **Works from any directory** | No — requires full path or `cd` to repo | Yes — available globally after install |
| **Update** | `git pull` | `Update-Module AzVMAvailability` |
| **Tab completion & Get-Help** | Requires dot-sourcing first | Works immediately |
| **Use in automation scripts** | `. .\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1` (dot-source) | `Import-Module AzVMAvailability` |
| **Parameters & output** | Identical | Identical |

### Staying Up to Date

- **Module users**: Run `Update-Module AzVMAvailability` periodically, or check your installed version with `Get-Module AzVMAvailability -ListAvailable`.
- **Script users**: Run `git pull` to get the latest version.
- **Release notifications**: Click **Watch** → **Custom** → **Releases** on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ZacharyLuz/Get-AzVMAvailability) to be notified of new versions.

## Support & Responsible Use

This tool queries only **public Azure APIs** (SKU availability, quota, retail pricing) against your own Azure subscriptions. It reads subscription metadata (such as subscription IDs/names, regions, quotas, and usage) and writes results locally (console output and CSV/XLSX exports); it does **not** transmit this data off your machine except as required to call Azure APIs.

- **Issues & PRs**: Welcome! Please do not include subscription IDs, tenant IDs, internal URLs, or any confidential information.
- **Azure support**: For Azure platform issues or outages, contact [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/) — not this repository.
- **Exported files**: Review CSV/XLSX exports before sharing externally — they may contain subscription IDs, region information, quotas, and usage details for your environment.

## Troubleshooting

### Security warning when running downloaded script

If Windows warns that the script came from the internet, unblock it once:

```powershell
Unblock-File .\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1
```

### `AzureEndpoints` property error at startup

If you see an error like `The property 'AzureEndpoints' cannot be found on this object`, you are likely running an older script copy.

```powershell
Select-String -Path .\Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1 -Pattern 'AzureEndpoints\s*=\s*\$null'
```

If this command returns a match, the file you are running still contains the old code path and should be replaced with the current `Get-AzVMAvailability.ps1` wrapper from this repo, or you should run the module directly with `Import-Module .\AzVMAvailability`.

If the command returns no output, that stale-copy marker is not present in this file. Confirm you are launching the expected script path and not another older copy from a different folder.
